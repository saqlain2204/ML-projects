# 🌺 Iris Species Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) 🌺

This machine learning project aims to predict the species of iris flowers based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset used in this project is taken from the scikit-learn library.

## 📝 Problem Statement

The iris dataset consists of 150 samples with three different species of iris flowers. Each sample contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Our task is to build a machine learning model that can predict the species of iris flower based on these four features.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3 🐍
- Scikit-learn 🧪
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🌊

## 🤖 Model Building

I will use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for our classification task. SVM is a popular algorithm for classification tasks as it can handle non-linear decision boundaries.

I have tuned the hyperparameters of the SVM algorithm using regularization, gamma, and kernels. The final model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test set.

## 📈 Results

I evaluated our model on the test set and achieved an accuracy of 98%.

## 📝 Conclusion

In this project, I used SVM to classify the species of iris flowers based on four features. I was able to achieve an accuracy of 98% on the test set. SVM is a powerful algorithm for classification tasks and can handle non-linear decision boundaries.
