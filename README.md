# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my machine learning projects, which I've completed as part of my learning process. Each project folder contains a README file with a brief description of the project, as well as any relevant instructions on how to run the code.

## 📂 Projects

- [Project 1: House cost prediction](./house-cost-prediction/)
- [Project 2: Employee Salary prediction](./Employee%20salary%20prediction-linear%20regression%20with%20multi%20variable/)
- [Project 3: Employee Retention Analysis](./Employee_Retention_Analysis_logistic-regression/)
- [Project 4: Identify Handwritten Numbers](./multiclass%20classification-logistic%20regression/identifying%20handwritten%20digits)
- [Project 5: Iris flower species identification](./multiclass%20classification-logistic%20regression/iris%20flower)
- [Project 6: Titanic Survival Prediction](./Titanic%20survival%20prediction%20using%20decision%20tree)
- [Project 5: Iris flower species identification USING SVM](./SVM/Iris%20species%20prediction%20uing%20SVM)

## 🚀 Getting Started
