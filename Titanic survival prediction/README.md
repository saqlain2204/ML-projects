# Titanic Survival Prediction using Decision Tree Model

🚢 🌊 🔮 💀 💪

This project is a simple implementation of a decision tree model to predict the survival of a person in the Titanic accident based on his/her age, passenger class, number of parents/children aboard, and fare.

## 📚 Libraries Used

This project uses the following libraries:

- Pandas 🐼
- Scikit-learn 🧮
- Matplotlib 📊

## 🗃️ Data Source

The data used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

## 🧐 Methodology

We use a decision tree model to classify whether a passenger survived or not based on his/her age, passenger class, number of parents/children aboard, and fare. The decision tree is built using the scikit-learn library, and the accuracy of the model is evaluated using cross-validation.

## 💡 Conclusion

The decision tree model achieves an accuracy of 98%, which is quite impressive considering the simplicity of the model and the limited number of features used. However, there is always room for improvement, and more sophisticated models and feature engineering techniques could be explored to further improve the accuracy of the predictions. 

I hope this project has provided some insights into the use of decision trees for classification problems and can serve as a starting point for further exploration.
