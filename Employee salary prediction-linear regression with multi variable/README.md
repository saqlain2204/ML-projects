# 📝 Employee Salary Prediction using Linear Regression with Multivariable

This is a project that predicts the salary of an employee based on their experience, interview score, and test scores. It uses linear regression with multivariable to make the prediction. The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook.

## 📦 Libraries Used
The following libraries were used in this project:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn

## 📁 Data
The dataset used in this project contains information about the experience, interview score, test score, and salary of employees. It is saved in a CSV file named `data.csv`.

## 🧮 Algorithm
Linear regression with multivariable was used to build the prediction model. This algorithm finds the relationship between the dependent variable (salary) and the independent variables (experience, interview score, and test score).

## 🛠️ Implementation
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook named `Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb`. It contains the following sections:
- Data Loading and Exploration
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Training and Testing
- Model Evaluation

## 📊 Results
The model was able to predict the employee salary with an accuracy of 92%.

## 🚀 Conclusion
Linear regression with multivariable is a good algorithm for predicting employee salary based on their experience, interview score, and test score. With an accuracy of 92%, this model can be used to make informed decisions about employee salaries.
