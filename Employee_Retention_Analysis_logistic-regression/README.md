# 📊 Employee Retention Analysis using Logistic Regression 📈

This data science project uses logistic regression to predict employee retention based on various parameters including employee salary, satisfaction, promotion, work accident, and average monthly working hours. The project includes data visualization using bar graphs to analyze the relationship between these parameters and employee retention.

## 📝 Project Overview 

The main objective of this project is to analyze the factors that affect employee retention and to build a predictive model using logistic regression. The project uses a dataset that includes information on employee salary, satisfaction, promotion, work accident, and average monthly working hours. The project begins by exploring the data and visualizing the relationships between the variables using bar graphs. 

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques 

The project is implemented using Python programming language and popular data science libraries such as:
- Pandas 🐼 for data manipulation
- NumPy 🔢 for numerical operations
- Scikit-learn 🤖 for machine learning algorithms
- Matplotlib 📊 and Seaborn 🌊 for data visualization

## 🤖 Model and Prediction 

The logistic regression model takes into account employee salary, satisfaction, promotion, work accident, and average monthly working hours to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company or not. The model is trained on the dataset and the performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The final model predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company or not based on the above parameters.

## 📊 Data Visualization 

The project includes data visualization techniques using bar graphs to analyze the relationship between employee retention and different variables such as employee salary, satisfaction, promotion, work accident, and average monthly working hours. The bar graphs help to visualize the trends and patterns in the data and identify the important features for building the predictive model. 

## 📈 Conclusion 

The project concludes by identifying the important factors that affect employee retention and building a predictive model using logistic regression. The project also includes data visualization techniques using bar graphs to analyze the relationship between different variables. The final model predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company or not based on the above parameters. This project can be useful for HR managers in managing their employees based on the ratings given by them.
